# primerscheme-specs
PCR amplicon sequencing enables cost-effective whole genome sequencing and characterisation of target genes, but these primer schemes lack standardised data formats, a problem highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we describe a text-based specification using `primer.bed` and `reference.fasta` files to standardise primer scheme definitions and facilitate data exchange for synthesis, lab work, and bioinformatics.
